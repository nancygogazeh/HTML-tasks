<p style="text-align: center;"" > Al-Salṭ, also spelled Salt orEs-Salt, town, west-central Jordan. It is on the old main highway (often called the Al-Salṭ Road) leading from Amman to Jerusalem. The town is situated in the Al-Balqāʾ highland, about 2,600–2,750 feet (about 790–840 metres) above sea level, and is built on two hills, one of which has the ruins of a 13th-century fortress.
